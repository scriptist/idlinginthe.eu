            - I left Tübingen on the bus to Stuttgart airport, then after a lovely late breakfast at the airport boarded my plane to Heathrow. This was the first time I’d flown without Sunny, but she was soon to follow – later the same day in fact! After landing in Heathrow (and having some trouble with my bus from the airport, which departed without notifying anybody of its arrival) I eventually made it to Brookwood Railway Station where I was met by Grandma – she drove me for the final leg of the lengthy journey, and showed me the hotel room she had booked for me and Sunny in Bisley.

            - We then met up with Papa and my aunt Karen, the rifle shooters of the family – Grandma was just there as a spectator. Unfortunately neither had made it through to the final event which would take place the following day, but they assured me it would still be fun to watch.
            - Karen gave me a tour of the site – I’d seen a lot of photos growing up, so it was lovely to be there to see it all in person. We then went to one of the local pubs and had some beers while looking at all the photos of past events and teams on the pub’s walls – quite a few including both Papa and Karen! We then met the Killians for dinner at their small holiday house – John was a retired butcher, so the meat was fantastic. After dinner I received a phone call from Sunny informing me that she’d be at Brookwood Station soon, so Grandma and I drove back in to meet her.

        text: The day I left Germany for London was incredibly hot, so I was looking forward to getting into London. Following a short flight filled with reading and delicious British Airways snacks, we landed at Heathrow, I forked out forty quid for a return Heathrow Express train ticket into the city (this was painful, but the alternative would’ve taken longer and it was already kinda late at night). After a series of train trips during which I read some Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, I arrived in Bisley where I was met by Michael and Moire. We drove to Bisley Pavilion and basically went straight to sleep.

            - The shooting started while we were eating lunch (it was quite loud of course), so after we finished we headed out to watch. During a short break in the shooting we saw a RAF marching band playing a series of pop songs from the 70’s and 80’s, including Sex Bomb, Thriller, and Don’t Stop Me Now.

The chair is then carried to each and every pub in the camp, where the winner is supplied with free beer. This starts at about 4pm and goes well into the night – we witnessed the beginning of the celebration, led by the RAF marching band playing traditional songs. We then retired to our hotel room and rested before dinner.

        text: Graeme and Moire then took us to the White Hart for dinner, where the food was excellent and very pleasingly (almost distressingly) filling. I remember the inside of the restaurant being heavily wooded in terms of having a lot of timber decor, with low-ish lighting, but also with an abundance of mirrors and stuff that made it feel less claustrophobic than it otherwise may have. ...What I’m writing here makes the ambience sound awful, but it was actually really nice. Service was great too. Would visit again if I had the chance.

        text: When we returned from dinner at about 11pm we noticed the winner of the shooting being carried to his next pub. Karen, Sunny and I left the car and followed him. The men carrying him had had a fair bit to drink, so the chair was a fair bit less stable than before, and the winner almost fell out! After seeing him arrive safely at his next pub, we decided to head back to our rooms for the night.

We found a lovely shop (very highly rated on TripAdvisor) called Pieminister for lunch, and for dessert we ate frozen yoghurt in a hot pink double-decker bus by the Thames.

        text: In the afternoon, Michael and I headed out to London to watch the Matilda musical at the Cambridge theatre. I was quite curious about it, because I liked the book that it was based on (and the movie adaptation) and I knew Tim Minchin was a pretty good lyricist/musician... meanwhile, Michael had not read the book at all and didn’t know anything about it (!???!!?), so I was curious about his reaction. The musical itself turned out to be pretty good, although not as... incredible... as it could have been. But still enjoyable! Couldn’t make out some of the lyrics, which was a shame, but overall a good performance with some very heart-wrenching moments.

        text: Once back in Bisley, we had dinner with Moire and Graeme at Forbidden City, a Chinese restaurant near where we were staying. This place made me realise that I had not had good Asian food at all since arriving in Germany, because wow, I have not derived so much joy from fried rice before. So yes, the food was excellent and it, together with the whole UK/Anglosphere/cultural similarity to Australia thing, made me intensely homesick for a short time.

        text: On the final day of my short Bisley weekend, Michael and I had breakfast and hung out a bit with the Bermans present before Moire drove us to the train station. I boarded my train into London, then spent some time wandering around the vague Leicester Square area, shopping for a jacket. I found a nice one at Zara which had a detachable fleece/fur lining, then headed off to Heathrow... seeing, on my way there, a man walking a ferret on a leash down the street. This was amazing. Once I got to Heathrow, I found that the boarding gate for my flight wasn’t appearing on the information boards, despite having meant to appear ages ago... and so I gravitated toward some similarly confused/stranded Germans who were going on the same flight and hung around in their vague vicinity until the flight info finally appeared. And then I flew back to Stuttgart and took the bus back to Tübingen, where I then collapsed in tiredness.

        text: While Sunny was heading back to Stuttgart, I went shopping with Grandma for a warm jacket – I expected the weather to be rather warm and hadn’t brought one. We then headed back to the hotel and relaxed, something which became somewhat of a trend for the week.

        text: In the morning, Grandma and Papa drove me up to Hemel Hempstead Snow Centre – an indoor ski slope with real snow! I hadn’t been skiing in over ten years so I was a little nervous standing at the top of the slope and staring down, but apparently I hadn’t forgotten too much! I spent about two hours going up and down the slope while Grandma and Papa watched from the nice warm cafe above.

Grandma, Papa and I piled our luggage into their car and drove to Heathrow, where we returned the car and transferred our belongings into a taxi to head to the hotel. After checking in, we had a long comfortable lunch at a restaurant across the street called The Blue Boar. We then retired to our respective rooms, and I waited patiently for Sunny’s arrival once again.

        text: Flying to London for the third time in a year and the second time in a week, I unsurprisingly was asked a lot of questions at UK immigration, which was a mildly harrowing but not unexpected experience. Then I proceeded to get lost on the London Underground, due partly to confusion induced by delays, and partly due to my lack of good navigation skills. Eventually I made it to the Sanctuary House Hotel, where Michael met me, and then we went to sleep about an hour or so before midnight (I got really lost).

            - The next day, Graeme and Moire took us out to lunch at London’s oldest restaurant, a place called Rules which was established in 1798. It was one of the fanciest places I’ve been too, and pretty impressive. The walls were packed with framed pictures, mounted animal skulls, etc., and the overall effect was very much that of an upmarket culinary institution. The food was quite lovely – I ordered venison, which was sourced from the restaurant’s own private game grounds – and the ambience was great.
            - In the evening, it was time to head over to Her Majesty’s Theatre to watch The Phantom of the Opera. I hadn’t seen it before, but some of my friends had been very much into it during high school, so I basically knew the plot... which didn’t sound that good, to be honest. But Michael had assured me that it was the production that made it amazing, and once the theme started playing early into the performance, I had to agree. I still think it’s a creepy story but the production was rather enjoyable.

        text: This was the day we had to say goodbye to my grandparents and start making our way through the United Kingdom, with the eventual goal of departing Newcastle upon Tyne by ferry in five days time. The four of us caught a taxi to Victoria Station, where Grandma and Papa waited for the bus to their cruise ship. Sunny and I said goodbye, and boarded our train to Brighton.

            - We arrived in Brighton. And the weather was incredibly awful in a way that was very quintessentially British, which actually made it vaguely pleasing in hindsight. Everything was grey, it was raining, incredibly windy (umbrella-destroying weather), and freezing cold. Other than that, I think Brighton was actually a rather pretty place. Seeing a coastline for the first time in months was a plus, and the seaside was really nice, I just couldn’t fully appreciate it because I was freezing to hyperbolic death at the time.
            - While walking along the Brighton seaside, huddled against the wind, we spotted a lone restaurant projecting out over the beach, and decided to have lunch there because it was a very convenient shelter from the weather. It also looked nice. The food we had there was quite fancy and a bit pricey, but also delicious and filling. I had a crab meat entree and spaghetti bolognese, and Michael had the biggest calzone I’d ever seen in my life.

            - I just want to say, it was a really big calzone. As you can see above, but just... it was huge!
            - Anyway, we headed back to our hotel in the rain where we each took a bath to warm up, then spent most of the afternoon and evening drinking tea and avoiding the weather. Very British, if you ask me.

        text: The next morning we slept in a bit, then enjoyed a buffet English breakfast at the hotel. English breakfasts are great. Granted, I tend to not really enjoy a third of the stuff (tomato, eggs), but the rest is great. Hot food is great. English breakfasts are a welcome change from the tasty but cold continental breakfasts of Europe.

        text: We caught our train back to London, then used the Underground to get to another station, then boarded another train and another after that (four trains!) we arrived at Windermere station. Windermere is a town famous for not actually being on Lake Windermere – instead it is about fifteen minutes walk up the hill. Sunny had booked us in in the top floor room of a lovely little bed and breakfast run by a charming couple named Yana and Ian – they helped point us in the right direction so we could walk down to the lake. In retrospect the directions were rather simple – walk downhill until your feet get wet, then you’re in the lake.

            - If I recall correctly, Bowness used to be a town separate from Windermere, but they’ve since sort of merged (unofficially, I think??) because they are about fifteen minutes on foot apart. Anyway, Bowness is on Windermere Lake, which was very pretty despite the very overcast weather. The lake was large, silky grey expanse that was inhabited with an abundance of geese and swans, which I thought were adorable because I like virtually all avian life.

            - Then we wandered around and found a pub, where we hung out drinking and then played a game of pool on a mini table. I am vaguely awful at pool, but not quite as awful as the worst pool player imaginable, so it was still fun.

        text: I, for the record, am also rather awful at pool, but apparently just good enough to beat Sunny. Definitely not too good for the game to become uninteresting or one-sided.

I tried a bit, and it was actually quite excellent, but I didn’t buy more because I’d left most of my UK currency at the hotel. Sadly.

Edinburgh is hands down the most beautiful city we’ve seen in the UK, and it was a lovely mix of old and new. It is filled with incredible old buildings sitting right next to fantastically designed modern ones, and their old castle is still in use today as a military installation. I also popped into a store there to buy a Kindle so I could read while I travelled (Sunny already had one).

            - The rest of the day was mostly spent just wandering a bit through Edinburgh. I like Edinburgh, it’s a really nice city. It’s big enough that it has this cool big city vibe and there’s stuff going on and you’re not far away from diverse food options, entertainment, shopping, pleasing throng of people, etc., but it’s also not so gigantic and congested as London... according to my very brief tourist’s impression of it. Also, the architecture is lovely and Scottish accents are great.

The local history that she told us about was mostly filled with wars, changes of government, and the typically gory stuff you’d imagine from the historical British Isles.
            - 'For example, we visited a monument which was where two Edinburgh-dwellers were punished for treason against Oliver Cromwell. The crime of one man had been proposing a toast to the exiled king; the crime of the other was agreeing. The former had his tongue nailed to the monument, the latter his ear. By the way, this story was told through some impromptu acting, where Jen was the first traitor and I was the second, because I’d been volunteered by Michael, who is a sadist and likes making me do audience participation.'

Somehow deep-frying a Mars Bar made it taste way more sweet than usual (???) and also way more unhealthy (duh). Definitely worth a try though.'
