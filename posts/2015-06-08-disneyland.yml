        text: On a Friday afternoon that was positively Australian in its blistering heat, I met up with Michael after class and proceeded to head to Tübingen Hauptbahnhof. We were going to Disneyland Paris over the weekend, a trip which overlapped by happy accident with our first anniversary. On the way to the train station, Michael told me we would be staying at a hotel that was one train stop away from the Disneyland park, and a further fifteen minute walk from the nearest train station. And I thought, “Hmm, I can’t help thinking that’s not ideal, but that’s still awesome seeing how Michael organised this whole trip as a semi-surprise to celebrate our anniversary, so whatever.”

        text: And then Michael announced that we weren’t actually staying at that hotel at all, but instead at the Radisson Blu, which was rather closer to Disneyland and also rather fancier, e.g. included a pool. With this new piece of information, we made a very hurried and efficient shopping trip for swimwear, before boarding our train to Frankfurt.

        text: One train ride and one flight later, we landed in Charles de Gaulle Airport. When we got to arrivals, I was wondering how exactly we’d get to Disneyland - via Paris proper, perhaps? - when Michael wandered off to make a mysterious phone call. Shortly after, I spotted a man in a suit holding a sign with Michael’s name on it - it turned out he’d booked a driver to take us directly to our hotel. Which was pretty great.

        text: After a leisurely drive at dusk, we reached the general Disneyland area - the parks, the partner hotels, and other related facilities. Michael opened up Google Maps on his phone and showed me the screen.

        text: “So see here,” he said, pointing at the display, “that’s the Radisson Blu. But to get there, we should have turned right at that intersection there... I wonder why we didn’t do that…”

        author: sunny
        text: And that was when the realisation dawned on me that everything Michael had said about the Radisson Blu must have been another elaborate lie, which meant he must have planned something even better, at which point I just turned to stare at him in silence with a happy/excited grin on my face.

        text: Shortly after this, our driver pulled up outside none other than the Disneyland Hotel in all its old-timey, fairytale-pretty splendour. It was a rosy pink building of a few stories tall that was quite expansive, with ornate architectural details like spires and decorative white wooden trim. The main reception area was rather opulent, with a high ceiling, chandeliers, rich carpeting, and beautiful paintings - not to mention figurines in glass cases of Disney characters which decorated the coffee table at the foot of a grand staircase.

        text: The best part about the hotel? It was located within spitting distance of the entry gates to Disneyland. We’re talking a matter of metres away. In short, I was pretty impressed. (It’s the beautiful glowing building in the picture below, as viewed from inside Disneyland.)

        text: After checking in, we settled into our room for the first of three nights. It was a high-ceilinged, spacious room that also felt rather cosy due to the decor - it felt like a guest house in a forest manor of a Disney film, with wooden furniture, pastel shades, and floor-to-ceiling windows that opened onto a garden. There were Disney details everywhere, such as the Peter Pan illustration decorating a cabinet, and in the wooden frame of the large bathroom mirror which was carved with small portraits of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

        text: The following morning we woke up bright and early to take advantage of Extra Magic Hours - guests of Disney hotels can get into the park two hours before it officially opens. We skipped breakfast and went straight into the park at 8am. After walking through the gates, we were greeted to a view of a beautifully empty Main Street USA, running down towards the center of the park. As we began our walk we were greeted by Donald Duck - he was always in character, and was very entertaining to spend time with.

        text: 'I then took Sunny to the ride I had been telling her about for weeks - It’s a Small World. This ride is rather nauseatingly childish, but in a somewhat charming way: you board a small boat, and travel through a world of gleefully dancing puppets, with sections representing countries and cultures throughout the world. For about five minutes, your ears are of course constantly treated to <i>It’s a Small World</i> played in different languages throughout the ride.'

        text: For lunch, we went to Inventions, a buffet restaurant on the second floor of our hotel. It was a lovely dining room, with windows that looked on to Main Street and decorative sculptures of various inventions hanging from the ceiling - a horse and cart, an aeroplane, etc. The food itself was simply delicious.

        author: sunny
        text: The most notable about lunch at Inventions? We were regularly visited by Disney characters who would roam through the dining room and interact with guests. The actors all wore full-body mascot costumes that covered their faces, and were very expressive in their portrayals of their characters, which was pretty impressive. We got photos taken with them, of course.

        text: 'We spent the afternoon enjoying more of the park. A highlight was Big Thunder Mountain - this is a minecart-style roller coaster with a big twist: most of the ride takes place on an island. Specifically, you begin by going straight down into a tunnel, which travels underwater (and under the path of a three storey paddle steamer), before arriving right in the middle of their Wild-West themed mountain. As we came to expect, the scenery was astonishingly detailed - the island was littered with ornately decorated wooden huts, despite the fact that they’d only ever be seen by people zooming past at break-neck speeds.'

        text: We spent the afternoon enjoying the rides and attractions of the park before heading to dine at Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, a dinner-and-show event. It was a theatrical performance featuring cowboys and Native American characters, displays of trick riding and shooting, as well as horses and, indeed, a small herd of buffalo. The show was pretty energetic and entertaining, and was told in a Wild-West-accented mix of French and English. As for the food, it was both very filling and very good.

        text: After the show, we spent some more time in Disneyland and relaxed in our hotel room for a bit, before heading out for the <i>Disney Dreams!</i> closing show at 11pm. All I knew at that point was that the show was an event that was put on daily to signal the closing of the park. Michael and I gathered in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle at the entrance to main park complex, and waited.

        text: At 11pm, music started up and beams of light soared up from the ground, signalling the start of the show. I soon found out that <i>Disney Dreams!</i> was a light show which was projected onto the facade of the castle. The rough plot of the show was Peter Pan losing his shadow, which then travelled through a host of other stories. And so we got to watch a show that included scenes and songs from The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Ratatouille, Frozen, and many more. The way the light was projected used the form of the castle to its advantage, creating an incredible show of colour and illusion to build a variety of scenes. And, of course, there were some spectacular fireworks to accompany the show and to finish it off.

        text: The next day, we returned to Inventions to dine on a buffet breakfast. There were no visiting Disney characters this time, but the food was just as excellent as our previous day’s lunch. It turns out that croissants in a five star Paris hotel are delicious - as were the other offerings, pastries or not.

        text: After a bit of time going for a relaxing walk (and enjoying It’s A Small World once more), we started waiting outside the train station inside the park. To be clear, this isn’t some metropolitan train or anything, this is Disney’s own steam train which runs circuits around the outside of the park. We’d seen it the previous day with a 90 minute wait time, so we thought it best to enjoy it first thing in the morning. We boarded the first train of the day, and spent about 15 minutes relaxing as we circled the park.

        text: We decided to spend our second day at Disneyland exploring Walt Disney Studios Park, which was adjacent to Disneyland Park but had a little more focus on movie-making rather than recreating the world of Disney. The many rides there also seemed to be more on the thrill-seeker end of the spectrum.

        author: sunny
        text: One of the best rides was the Rock’n’Rollercoaster, which was an indoor roller coaster which I admittedly had my doubts about, in that the pairing with rock music seemed a little ... strange? But at that point I’d decided I liked roller coasters, so it was all good.

        text: Our queue for the ride led us through a sort of rock music hall of fame, with glass cabinets populated by memorabilia of Santana, Pearl Jam, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the like. Then we entered a “recording studio”, which was a space set up with recording equipment that had a screen at the back playing footage of Aerosmith ostensibly designing the ride and the music to go with it. (Presumably it was them. I know nothing about Aerosmith so really they could have had random people dress up pretending to be them, and I wouldn’t have known.)

        author: sunny
        text: The boarding area of the roller coaster continued the record studio theme, complete with an impressive array of studio lights hanging from the ceiling. Apart from the colourful lighting, the ride area was quite dark. I watched the cars in front of us fill up and go shooting into a tunnel, and then it was our turn.

        author: sunny
        text: It turns out that the Rock’n’Rollercoaster, despite the vaguely-gimmicky music conceit, was actually an amazing ride. It was full of loops and corkscrews through mostly-darkness lit by sparsely-placed decorative coloured lights, and accompanied by a rock soundtrack that totally worked.

        text: 'Next up was the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, set in an incredibly tall fake hotel building called the Hollywood Tower Hotel, constructed at a cost of over €180 million. We were seated in a small “elevator”, which was pushed backwards by pistons into the elevator shaft. We were at ground level, and we knew how tall the ride was so we expected the elevator to start rising, but they surprised us: we dropped immediately down into the a hole in the ground. For the next few minutes, we were treated to a wild ride moving up and down, during which the elevator doors opened several times to reveal various creepy scenes within the hotel. It culminated with the elevator doors opening to show us that we had reached the top floor, looking directly out at a brilliant view over both Disney parks. And then we dropped straight to the ground.'

        text: We then visited an exhibition about Disney and animation. This first took us through a sort of mini-museum, a room where early examples of animation technology (e.g. rotoscopes) were displayed. We were then led to a small theatre to watch a compilation of scenes from animated Disney films. Finally, we moved to an a different theatre and watched a video that talked through the conceptual design of Mushu, the dragon companion in <i>Mulan</i>.

        text: Our next destination was the Moteurs Action stunt show. We took our seats in a small stadium, where instead of a sports field there was a film set showing a street of shop fronts, with ample space where we watched various motor stunts being performed. The first performer was a motorcyclist who did a lot of impressive tricks (e.g. rearing up on one wheel, riding while standing on his bike). We also watched a car chase, which was then followed by an interesting ’behind the scenes’ explanation of how the stunt worked. We found out, for example, that some of the stunt cars were built out of fibreglass (much lighter than metal) and powered by motorcycle engines which, also lighter, allowed for greater manoeuvrability. Other highlights of the show also included a stunt where the performer slid through a wall of flame and stumbled, on fire, for several metres before being extinguished (we later saw the many layers of protective clothing he was wearing at the time), and a car chase followed by several dramatic explosions.

        text: 'Next we boarded a tram, which took us on a circular route past some props and vehicles used in Disney’s slightly more action packed movies, such as Armageddon. We then saw some fantastically detailed fake movie sets, and were treated to a brilliant example of practical effects: a fake movie shoot in which a couple of oil drums exploded in huge fireballs, and a powerful flood swept away a fuel tanker - we then watched everything neatly reset its position for the next visitors, and a video of Jeremy Irons explained exactly how it was all done.'

        text: Later that day at 5:30pm, we gathered on Main Street to watch the parade. It was a long and fantastic procession of Disney characters on themed floats. We saw a bunch of the princesses and their princes (Snow White, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, etc.) as well as, of course, Elsa and Anna from <i>Frozen</i>. The actors were all fantastically in-character with great costumes. There were also some very impressive costumes for the three fairies from <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, who moved by gliding gracefully across the ground - they must have been standing on some kind of wheeled transport hidden beneath their dresses. The parade finished with a huge float featuring Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Mickey presiding above them all in his wizard’s garb from <i>Fantasia</i>.

        text: We decided to celebrate the anniversary of our first date by having a rather fancy dinner at one of the hotel’s restaurants, California Grill. After placing our orders on iPads delivered by our waiter, we enjoyed delicious food directly above Disneyland’s entrance, with a beautiful view down Main Street USA. We both ordered cheese for dessert, but we weren’t posh enough to work out how to eat it! It was served on its own, not even cutlery was provided, so we assumed that we were meant to use our butter knives (the only cutlery remaining on the table) to apply it to the bread that had been served before our entree. We still don’t know if that was correct.

        text: In the later evening hours, the park was relatively - blissfully - empty. It still felt lively, but the queues for the rides were way shorter than during daytime. So of course, we took advantage of this and visited our favourites multiple times. One of these was the Indiana-Jones-themed roller coaster - which had been my first ride on a looping roller coaster the previous day. Michael suggested the challenge of riding the entire roller coaster with our eyes closed, which I eventually agreed to. This proved to be mildly terrifying but also incredibly fun.

        text: To finish off our second day, we made our way back to the castle at the entrance and watched <i>Disney Dreams!</i> for the second time. It was the exact same format as the previous night’s performance, but this time we managed to find a spot a little closer to the action. I marvelled a little at the thought of Disney’s firework consumption, as well as at what it must cost in money and effort to maintain the magic of the park, and after enjoying the song medley and light show once more, we returned to the hotel.

        text: On the morning of our final day, we had a quick breakfast at Inventions before making our way to Walt Disney Studios Park to visit Crush’s Coaster, a roller coaster ride which we’d seen the day before but which always had monstrously long queues. Our plan of heading there first thing in the morning as soon as the park opened was successful. After queuing for about ten minutes or so, we boarded the roller coaster. The ride was based on the movie Finding Nemo, specifically the scene in which the turtles travelled through the East Australian Current. Our seats were large turtle shells, and the ride was an adventure through the dark that consisted of many twists, turns, and drops which really evoked the sense of being tossed around in a current quite well.

        text: 'We headed back to the hotel to check out, and left our bags with them for one final roam through the park. We discovered one area we hadn’t seen before - a small princess-themed area with just two rides: a kids roller coaster, and a kids boat ride with little models depicting various fairy tales. So, of course, we went on them. With just about an hour left, we re-visited our two favourite rides: the Indiana Jones roller coaster and the minecart coaster. We went for one final wander through the park, and Sunny bought a Lilo and Stitch badge (which she is wearing right now as I write this).'

        text: At 1pm, the time came for us to leave the hotel and make our way back home. The same driver who’d taken us to the hotel met us at reception and drove us back to the airport. Throughout our journey back home, we took turns writing the recap of the weekend which you’re reading now on a fold-up keyboard that Michael bought.

        text: To end this recount, I’d like to point out that Michael was pretty amazing for organising this whole trip and taking us to Disneyland Paris on our anniversary. On the way to the airport he asked for my opinion on his planning choices and how things turned out. I replied that it was perfect - and I absolutely stand by that.
