            - After our trip through Europe, we boarded the MSC Armonia for a week-long cruise through the Mediterranean which Michael had organised for us. It was pretty amazing.
            - We boarded at the Marseille cruise port and were led to our room. Michael had already booked a very nice room with a balcony, and upon arrival, we suspected that we had actually been upgraded to a suite. The room was incredibly spacious (quite possibly the same size as our student apartment in Tübingen), with furniture on the balcony, a leather sofa, and even a bath.
            - We relaxed in our room for a while, and then wandered up to the buffet for a snack where we enjoyed a multitude of dishes. We also decided to buy the Allegrissimo drinks package, which let us get unlimited drinks and ice cream for the duration of the cruise.
            - That evening, we enjoyed a lovely dinner in the on-board restaurant, La Pergola. It was quite fancy, and we were pretty underdressed in our very comfortable ‘travelling through Europe for weeks’ attire. After dinner we made use of our drinks package to try some of the cocktails before going to sleep in our excellent room.

            - Part of our cruise package included breakfast delivered to the room daily, so we ate our first breakfast on the balcony looking out to the sea. We then headed down to the onboard casino for free gambling lessons, as Sunny wanted to learn to play roulette and blackjack. After the lessons, we were each given a free €5 voucher, on the condition that we bet €10 of our own money.
            - Despite knowing that the voucher made things mathematically in her favour, Sunny (probably wisely) decided to avoid the risk, so I asked her to play her voucher with my money for me (as I wasn’t allowed to use both vouchers myself). I first put my €10 and voucher on red at the roulette table, and won! Sunny then put my next €10 and her voucher on even, and won once  again! So I was now up €40. Despite the early win, neither Sunny nor I were addicted to gambling, and walked away… after first losing €5.
            - I used my winnings to buy myself a nice shirt and a packet of chips for Sunny.

            - Our first shore excursion was to Palma de Mallorca. The port was peppered with vendors plying their wares, some selling fridge magnets and handbags, others peddling artisan crafts. Among the latter category we found a man who offered name necklaces sculpted out of wire, which he did incredibly quickly, in a minute or two. We were quite impressed. Michael then bought me a necklace with my name on it, because he’s lovely.

            - After walking past the cathedral, we noticed a large group of horses and carts, complete with rather excitable owners who were clearly ready to haggle. I wasn’t wholly fixed on the idea of the horse tour, so during one of my legitimate attempts to walk away I accidentally haggled the driver down to half the advertised price and decided this was a pretty good deal. So Sunny and I rode through the town, feeling very posh while having various beautiful landmarks pointed out to us by our driver.

            - In the city centre of Palma, we walked through a square that home to various street performers. One of the more novel ones was a man who had painted his face to look like a dalmatian and performed by crouching inside a kennel and basically pretending to be a dog.

            - After wandering down the shopping street (as Sunny wanted to buy some shorts), the rain started. We knew it was coming - there had been dark clouds all morning - but we’d foolishly ignored the signs. We whiled away some time in a department store, and eventually decided we should run back to the shuttle bus. We arrived at the boat soaking wet, so we showered and changed clothes for dinner.

            - "Wearing my lovely new shirt (thanks to the casino) and with Sunny in a beautiful dress she’d bought in Amsterdam, we enjoyed a nice fancy dinner feeling a little less out-of-place than we had the previous night in our t-shirts and jeans. We came across an event called King vs. Queen, in which alternating Michael Jackson and Queen songs were played, and audience members had to dash up to a chair on stage to identify the song as quickly as possible. I heard the beginning of Beat It and leapt into the chair, well ahead of some of the slightly less nimble passengers. After some applause and some light mockery of my Australian accent, I was awarded my prize: an MSC cruises visor. Just what I’d always dreamed of."

            - We woke up horribly seasick the next day and spent basically the entire morning lying prone and savouring the nausea. When we eventually recovered somewhat, we went to the Armonia Lounge and Library, where we participated in a trivia quiz and a memory game.

            - Our evening was fairly uneventful - we had tickets to one of the onboard shows, but weren’t really sure if it’d be worth watching. Well, it turned out to be a handful of Italian songs (in English, French, German, and of course Italian) - fairly well sung, but not exactly an incredible show. We snuck out after about twenty minutes and went to bed.

            - Our next shore excursion was at the port of Valetta, capital of Malta. We had some mixed impressions of the tiny, tiny country. Upon approach, we found the shoreline pretty magnificent, with gorgeous stone buildings. The part of the city near the coast was also fairly nice. We decided to go for a bus tour and spent a couple of hours riding in the open top of a double decker bus, listening to audio guides about the history of Malta. Once we headed inland, we were hit by the sheer smallness of the place and we decided Malta was a good place to visit but we perhaps wouldn’t want to live there.

            - We arrived in Messina fairly early in the morning. This was to be the first of three official shore excursions provided by MSC that we’d booked in advance. Today we would be visiting Mount Etna, followed by the beautiful town of Taormina.
            - We boarded the MSC bus, and enjoyed listening to a lot of interesting information provided by our local guide. After about an hour, we arrived!
            - It was a little foggy. Unfortunately, due to the fog (and the fact that tourists have a habit of getting lost) we were unable to do the walk we had planned, so we stopped at a cafe instead. Sunny and I snuck out to see an inactive crater less than a minute’s walk away, and discovered that even from there we couldn’t see the cafe we’d just come from, so we followed the line of parked tour buses to get back.

            - After seeing Etna, we spent the rest of our afternoon exploring the charming small town of Taormina. Its narrow, cobbled streets were filled with tourists and lined with boutiques. We had a light lunch at one of the restaurants recommended by our tour guide, and enjoyed the views before returning to our home aboard the cruise ship.

            - The next morning we had another shore excursion - this time to Pompeii. TODO finish this.

            - Upon returning from Pompeii, Michael dragged me up to the top deck of the ship to play mini golf, a game which I am never enthusiastic about but somehow end up enjoying when I do play it. It was quite interesting encountering the unique challenges to mini golf that being on a cruise ship presents, namely the wind.
            - On board the cruise, there were a few points where photographers had studio backdrops and lights set up, ready for cruise passengers to have their photos taken professionally if they so wished. That evening, we decided to dress in our fancy clothes (we each had one vaguely formal outfit each) to get some snaps of ourselves. 'Why not?' we thought, because the photo sessions themselves were free of charge - we only paid upon purchasing copies of the photos.

            - Our final shore excursion brought us to Pisa, home of the famously leaning tower. Our guide took us through some of the churches nearby, before giving us a run-down of the tower’s history. The tower ended up being somehow rather smaller than I expected. We also, of course, took some stereotypical photos with it.
            - On the way back to our bus, I engaged one of the many vendors of selfie sticks that were wandering around the carpark-turned-marketplace and bargained the price of one from €15 down to €3.50.

            - Once we got back to the boat, we popped by the photo shop and had a look at the pictures we’d taken the previous night. There were so many fantastic photos, but they were rather expensive - I decided to get just one of me and Sunny.

            - We awoke after a lovely night of rest - our final night on board the boat. We followed the disembarkation procedure (which was made much easier by the fact that we didn’t have suitcases), and headed to our next adventure - a surprise I’d organised for Sunny.

            - "Michael had mentioned before that he had arranged a surprise for me in Marseille. One taxi ride later, about half an hour away from the city centre, we arrived at it: a campsite by the name of Attrap Reves [TODO]. There were five campsites here, each one comprising of a large, air-filled, transparent bubble. Each bubble contained a lovely arrangement of furniture, power points, and a heater, and was at the end of its own secluded pathway, so that its inhabitants had privacy while feeling quite out in the open with nature. The place was simply amazing and the perfect place to relax after our weeks of travel."

            - After relaxing in our for a couple of hours, we ambled up to the dining room and found our dinner in two beautiful wooden boxes. Inside each were three other boxes - we microwaved one, and then turned the heater on and enjoyed a lovely solitary meal.
            - After that, we donned our swimwear and hopped in the jacuzzi - we had booked a specific time slot in advance, so we knew it would be free. It was in a small gazebo with large plexiglass windows, right in the middle of the woods. An absolutely beautiful view.

            - The next day, we picked up a breakfast basket from reception and took it back to our bubble to dine at the picnic table that sat next to it. We had delicious pastries, fresh orange juice, and hot chocolate, before packing up and bidding farewell to Marseille.
