            - After leaving the seclusion of <a href="/cruise">Attrap'Rêves</a>, we took a taxi to Marseilles Airport and boarded our flight to London Heathrow.

            - For the second time on the trip, we met up with Haein and Paul, this time in a London park near Big Ben. Unlike our meeting in Berlin, this had been planned ages in advance, since we’d booked The Book of Mormon tickets together. We all then made our way to the apartment we’d rented in Shoreditch and spent quite a while unpacking, setting up our various devices, and relaxing.

            - We then went to the nearby Tesco to do some grocery shopping. Paul left to meet up with a friend for dinner, while Michael, Haein, and I ordered Indian food from a restaurant called Mogul’s Kitchen to be delivered to our apartment. It was delicious and very filling, and enjoyed with a few episodes of American comedy TV shows that we watched on Michael’s laptop.

            - Sunny and I headed out to meet up with my Nana who lives in London, thus completing my trifecta of grandparents-met-in-London for the year. She cooked us a delicious Greek lunch, and after three or four hours we returned to the hotel.
            - That evening we saw War Horse – a play (recently turned into a movie) known not just for its storyline, but also its spectacular puppetry. The horse puppets were full-sized, controlled by three people, and were light enough that the horses could very realistically trot around the stage while being strong enough that they could be ridden by the actors. It was a very impressive performance.

            - In the morning, Michael and I embarked on an epic trek out of London to get to Hemel Hempstead Snow Centre, where Michael had gone skiing the last time he was in the UK. He had booked another lift pass, like last time, and I had booked a lesson as I had never been skiing before.

            - Skiing turned out to be incredibly fun. I didn’t find it too difficult, although I did have some issues with controlling speed and ended up going too fast and falling at the end a few times. It must be said, though – of all ways to fall when learning a new skill, into snow is a relatively comfortable one.

            - After having lunch at the Swiss-Alps-themed restaurant of the Snow Centre, we headed back to our apartment. There we met Haein and Paul and the four of us headed out to the Prince of Wales theatre to pick up our Book of Mormon tickets. We then spent an hour or so wandering the streets of Chinatown, consuming various foods and savouring the availability of Asian delicacies which are quite rare in small German university towns.
            - When Michael and I had first decided to watch The Book of Mormon again, I’d worried that I wouldn’t enjoy it as much the second time because I’d already know how everything would happen. As soon as the opening number started, I was very happily proved wrong. It is, simply, an incredibly awesome musical. We also had the joy of seeing our friends watch it for the first time and love it, just as we had done.

            - After we got home, we taught Haein how to play poker and the four of us stayed up for a couple of hours engaged in games with fake chips which Michael had prepared using cut up squares of paper.

            - After a long comfortable trip under the Channel, we caught the Paris Metro to our hotel. This hotel had received fairly poor reviews from other travellers, but we got lucky – rather than being housed in the main tower (which is apparently rather mouldy) we were allocated a nice ground floor room by the garden. It was well-kept and quiet, and after about half an hour with the window open it had a lovely neutral odour.

            - On our first full day in Paris, I decided to join a Sandeman’s free walking tour. Michael had already been on one during an earlier Paris visit, so I went by myself.

            - After a few hours of walking and seeing the sights, we met up at Place de la Concorde and spent some time hanging out at the Tuileries Gardens, which were very beautiful. We then had lunch at a self-serve cafe, and then headed back to our hotel. I was feeling very tired, so we spent the rest of the day in our room (mostly engaged in a very fun computer game Michael had discovered).

            - The next day, Michael took me to Montmartre, the famous artist district which he knew I’d like. We first caught the Metro into the area and had a quick look at the outside of the famous Moulin Rouge, before riding a funicular train up the hill.

            - We then spent some time strolling among the various artists at work, most of whom sold either pre-painted landscapes and cityscapes of Paris, or custom portraits in pencil, charcoal, and pastels. There were also a few artists who sold custom silhouettes. One of these was an elderly Asian man whose silhouettes stood out from the rest as they were impressively detailed. He also dressed his silhouette portrait subjects in fancy old-timey clothes and accessories, which was a charming touch – as you can see here in the silhouette of us that Michael bought.

            - In the afternoon, we caught the train to the Eiffel Tower. We were a little too late to go up it (the stairs had just closed and we weren’t keen on waiting three hours to go up the lift), so we relaxed nearby and then explored the area a little.

            - We had dinner at a nearby restaurant where food was excellent and the drinks were incredibly steeply priced. After that, we headed back to the lawn at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and hung out. Michael used his negotiating skills to get us a couple of cheap beers from the many, many vendors who wandered around with buckets of beverages, which we enjoyed while waiting for eight o’clock to roll around. When the time came, the tower lit up with sparkling lights and we enjoyed the show before returning home.

            - No stay in Paris is complete without a trip to the Louvre. Luckily, as European residents (if only for a year), we enjoyed free entry into the museum. One of the first famous pieces which we saw was the Winged Victory of Samothrace statue, which I’d seen pictures of and was quite pleased to see in person.

            - We’d both heard countless stories from friends about the Mona Lisa – “it’s smaller than you expect”, “you can barely see it through the crowds”, etc.
            - My expectations had been so lowered, that I actually found it rather lovely – the crowd was perhaps 30 people, and it turned out to be larger than I’d expected. After patiently waiting a few minutes, I found myself near the front of the crowd and enjoying a beautiful painting.

            - We also saw the iconic Venus de Milo, at which Michael took the opportunity to make bunch of puns about her being ‘unarmed’ and ‘[h]armless’.

            - After the Louvre, we headed to the Eiffel Tower with the mission to climb it. There are three levels to the tower. There is one elevator that takes you to the second level, and another that takes you to the top. The queues for these are monstrous. Alternatively, one can climb stairs to the second level and then ride to the top in an elevator (no stairs available for this bit). And so we embarked on our climb, whose 600-odd steps were not as bad as I’d anticipated. The views were predictably breathtaking and it was also amusing to see how identical so much of Paris’s architecture is.

            - After our Eiffel Tower trek, Michael headed back to the hotel while I visited the Musee d’Orsay, another art museum. This one was smaller than the Louvre, and much less crowded, which was lovely. I spent the time having a lovely leisurely wander, looking at works by Monet, Van Gogh, Seurat, and Degas.

            - Our final morning in Paris was spent resting in the hotel. We then hopped onboard the train home, which took us through the beautiful French countryside at 320 km/h and gave us a good chance to catch up on our travel blog.
