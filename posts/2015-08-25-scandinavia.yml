            - It was the first day of my parents’ visit to Europe, as well as the day of frustrating taxi rides. After waking up early, we called a taxi to take us to Arrivals at Frankfurt Airport. However, after much iteration on my part, he still took us to Departures instead (maybe my German’s awful? I don’t know). We then walked to Arrivals and met my parents, which was quite nice after not seeing them for months. Then we took a taxi back to the Element Hotel, which took rather longer than expected because our driver started heading into Frankfurt city by mistake. Eventually we got to the hotel and my parents had a bit of a post-flight rest, while Michael and I had breakfast. We then hopped onto a train to Tübingen, where my parents checked into Haus Albblick – the very same hotel that Michael’s mum and dad had stayed in when they made their visits earlier in the year.

            - After our rest we went out to lunch at Neckarmüller – the restaurant where we’ve taken all our Tübingen guests so far. We introduced Sunny’s parents to Spätzle, a type of German noodle, and all ended up incredibly full.

            - We then decided to enjoy the Neckar River from a new vantage point and hired a small plastic paddle boat. Sunny and I sat in the front and paddled while her parents relaxed in the back and enjoyed the view.

            - On the way back from our boat trip, we did some grocery shopping before parting ways to get some more rest (my parents after their long flight, Michael and I after our weeks of travel). In the evening, my parents came over to our place and cooked us a nice home-made and impressively extensive meal.

            - The next morning, Michael and I spent a while working out how we’d return from Copenhagen to Tübingen at the end of our upcoming holiday. None of the options were ideal, but we eventually settled on an eleven-hour train trip. My parents dropped by at noon, and we had lunch together before spending the rest of the afternoon resting at our respective residences.

            - When Dad had come here, we’d had dinner at a fantastic Italian restaurant called Zum Alten Fritz, so Sunny and I decided to use her parents as an excuse to enjoy their food once again. It’s built in… possibly an old cellar? Either way, the inside walls are nothing but a big stone archway, which gives it a pleasingly dramatic feel. After ordering, we realised that the two of us had both got the exact same food as we did last time! Afterwards, we wandered out and caught the bus back up the hill in preparation for our morning train trip to Zürich.

            - "Sunny and I packed our bags and wandered down to meet her parents at their hotel, where they’d already checked out and ordered a taxi. The train to Zürich seemed largely uneventful, until an announcement came over the loudspeaker: “The train is unable to proceed due to damage on the next bridge”! After a half hour wait, the train was routed to Singen instead (still in Germany), where we had to change onto another smaller train to Zürich."

            - We eventually made it, and picked up the keys to our rooms from a mechanical key box (as this hotel had no reception). It was about 3pm by this point, so we threw down our bags and dashed out to lunch. We visited a vegetarian buffet restaurant called SamSeS – each time you visit the buffet your plate is weighed, and at the end you are charged for the total mass. It was delicious, and we wisely avoided the cheaper foods like rice.

            - "After lunch we caught a tram into the city centre and hung out on the shores of Lake Zürich. I would like to take this moment to mention that the lake is very pretty and filled with an aesthetically pleasing assortment of avian life: swans, ducks, and gulls."

            - At one point, my mum noticed a man who was standing on a high ledge near the lake and dancing strangely to himself. She and Michael tried convincing me to join him (which I refused to do), and after the strange man left, she took his place and danced a bit too.

            - We then split up for a bit to explore Zürich in pairs. Michael decided that what he wanted to do was catch the Polybahn up to the university on a hill several times over, which we did, because Michael loves funicular railways.
            - That evening Michael and I took my parents to Felsenegg, a Swiss restaurant atop a mountain that we had visited on our first trip to Zürich. It was located a bit far out from the city centre and we had to take a S-bahn, walk through some hilly residential streets, then catch a cable car up the mountain. Once alighting the car, we made a short walk through a wooded area which was creepy as hell the first time Michael and I were there, as that time it was a dark night with a lot of fog and skeletal trees. This time, it was much more pleasant as late summer sunsets meant that there was still plenty of light. We also got to see the view much better.

            - Outside the restaurant there was a tiny chair swing with four seats. Michael fed one Swiss franc into the machine, but it failed to start. My mum and I sat in the seats, and Michael gave us a bit of a push. This seemed to kick-start the machine, which started spinning of its own accord. Michael hopped on with us and the three of us swung while my dad watched. It was pretty impressive for such a tiny rickety-looking chair swing, although I kept being paranoid that it’d break at some point.

            - We then went into the actual restaurant and had some very rich, very filling Swiss cuisine. Everything was either bready or potato-y, and it was pretty much all slathered with melted cheese. I ordered capuns, a Swiss dish of flour and ham logs wrapped in chard leaves, all in a cheese sauce, which I had been sporadically craving in Germany. It was good, but so painfully filling. That seemed to be the general consensus about the food.

            - For our last morning in Zürich, we split up again. I decided to visit the design museum. It turned out that there was currently a photography exhibition on, and no design exhibits; I wasn’t particularly interested in the photography exhibit so instead Michael and I just hung around in the small shop/display area in front of the museum. The glass cabinets there were filled with things like vegetable peelers, vases, pencils, notepads, etc. – all of which looked fairly nice, but which were incredibly expensive and set Michael off some insightfully critical ranting about pretentious design that valued form over function.
            - We met up with my parents in the afternoon, whereupon we headed to the airport for our flight to Helsinki. The trip was Swiss Air, who gave us some complimentary Swiss chocolate. A couple of hours later, we landed.

        text:
            - The lack of customs and security checks at the arrivals end of our trip briefly shocked my parents, who hadn’t (like us) had half a year to get used to the porous borders of the Schengen Zone. We found our way to a train that would take us from the airport into the city centre – after going about four or five escalators underground.

            - Our first impressions of Helsinki were that everything seemed very clean and efficient. I also noticed the light that came from a sun hanging very low in the sky – almost nine, I think it was, and it wasn’t even remotely dark. Everything was bathed in sunshine that was reminiscent of some kind of vintage-style photo filter. Getting into the city, we saw a lot of large, square, sort of monolithic architecture. My mother commented that it must have been because we were near Russia – we later found out that Helsinki had in fact been, at some point in the 1800s, styled by a Russian Tsar to look like a miniature St Petersburg.

            - In the morning, we caught a tram out to Market Square – a huge set of quayside markets. We spent some time looking at some of the stalls (we saw a lot of things made of reindeer), then Sunny sat down for a nice breakfast crêpe while her parents continued wandering.

            - It was an amazing park which had great rides and was relatively empty – we never waited more than five minutes or so to get onto a ride. So of course, we went on every single roller coaster in the place.
            - Here’s us after we went on a log flume ride. It started off as a pretty exciting roller coaster, then plunged into water at the end.

            - "The yellow roller coaster right behind me here was... interesting, to say the least. The cars were attached in such a manner roughly similar to a bead through which the track was threaded. This meant a lot of spinning back and forth and turning upside down."

            - After our breakfast buffet (we ate a lot of buffets) we arrived in Stockholm! We disembarked and found our hotel – it was a lovely new hostel, in which we had a little two bedroom apartment. The communal kitchen was right around the corner from our door, and was fantastic and clean (and had a free coffee machine which served excellent hot chocolates). This was definitely my favourite hotel.

            - That afternoon, Michael booked us a Segway tour of Stockholm. Aside from him, none of us had ridden a Segway before. We rocked up at the meeting point, where the staff showed us how to operate the vehicles. It turned out that we were the only people booked for that time, which was great. We went on a tour led by a Swedish woman whose name I’ve unfortunately forgotten, who was quite nice and told us some interesting things about Stockholm. We were also joined by a boy of about twelve who I think was her son, and whose job was to bring up the rear of our line of Segways weaving through the city. (How great would it be being the kid of parents who ran a Segway tour?)

            - Segways turned out to be a brilliantly fun method of transport, and an excellent way to see the beauty of Stockholm. Mum had a bit of trouble getting the hang of them and at one point unfortunately injured her foot, but she nonetheless got used to it by the end and agreed that they were great fun.

            - The next morning we went on a tour on the Ocean Bus, which Michael had booked for us. As its name suggests, it is an amphibious bus whose tour starts on land and then spends some time in the water as a boat, before reemerging onto dry land. The tour was run by two brothers, one who drove and the other who delivered the tour. The latter brother entertained us with some funny commentary and stories as we made our way through Stockholm.

            - Sunny’s parents returned to the hotel so her mum could rest her foot, so Sunny and I wandered around the city on our own. We visited an American restaurant for some ribs & a burger, then boarded a bus to the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology. The downstairs section had the usual complement of robot arms and such, and a fantastic exhibit which projected a digital shadow of you and added majestic angel wings (which allowed your shadow to fly if you flapped hard enough). Upstairs, there was an exhibit called Digital Life, which included a lot of old & new video games – an original Pac Man arcade game, and even one of the earliest versions of Pong (in which I beat Sunny). Sunny’s favourite exhibit was a large tv screen which acted like a mirror, but with a clever effect making it look like it was hand drawn.

            - After the science museum, I led us to the Vasa Museum. Here lies the restored wreck of the ship Vasa, a seventeenth century warship built by the then Swedish monarch. He’d aimed to build a very impressive ship to assert Sweden’s power and prestige, and so the ship was huge and festooned with metal sculptures and ornamentation. It was also armed to the teeth with cannon. Unfortunately, some things had gone very wrong with the design of the ship and on its maiden voyage, it sank less than two miles into its journey. After lying at the bottom of the sea for 333 years, it was brought back up and restored, and now lies in the Vasa Museum, surrounded by informative plaques and displays about the ship and about Swedish seafaring at the time.

            - By this point, we had gone two days without being on a roller coaster and we decided enough was enough. We walked to Gröna Lund, a theme park built on the water’s edge not unlike Luna Park (but much bigger). The real star of the show was not a roller coaster though, it was a chair swing – the world’s highest. After sitting in the small metal chair, you are lifted 121 meters up and spun at 70 km/h around the tower. At this height, you are more than high enough to see over all of the city’s rooftops, so in between screaming for your dear life you do get treated to a rather lovely view. It is a little bigger than the chair swing in Felsenegg.

            - The park also had a rather large vertical sawblade ride, similar to the one in Helsinki but much longer. I’d put so much energy into convincing Sunny into doing it, it was only once I was strapped into the seat that I realised how terrified I was. It was by far the most exhilarating ride in the park, and it was especially scary spinning uncontrollably while the track jutted out over the water below.

            - We departed the hotel in the morning, and enjoyed our lovely first class train to Copenhagen. While the train looked rather Spartan on the outside, it was beautiful and spacious on the inside. Crossing the bridge between Sweden and Denmark was amazing – it started as a bridge, then dived into a tunnel on a man-made island, before coming out at Copenhagen Airport.

It was beautiful, though it did have four and a half drawbacks, each in the form of a flight of stairs we needed to climb to reach it. The view out the window was lovely though.

            - Sunny suggested we go on a Segway tour, as she’d come around to my way of thinking – it’s definitely the best way to quickly see and understand a new city. We made the trek down our majestic staircase, and walked through the city to reach the Segway tour shop.

            - Upon arrival, we were informed that this was the day of the Iron Man race, so we’d have to take a different route – one that didn’t pass the Little Mermaid Statue! We did, however, pass a statue of Hans Christian Andersen.

            - That morning we had planned to do some exploring of Copenhagen, however just as we were about to leave, the clouds opened up and started spilling rain out of their bellies. When the brief storm abated, Michael and I hiked down the mountain of stairs connecting our apartment to the street, and went for a walk.

            - Michael had booked us a boat rental with GoBoat that day, so we made a stop at a supermarket and bought some picnic lunch supplies. We then met up with my parents and set off on a boating trip through the Copenhagen canals.

            - The GoBoat was very easy to operate, quite stable, and could only go up to about six knots so it felt rather safe. The electric motor was also pleasantly quiet.

            - We made our boating trip according to a route that the staff had drawn up for us, which took us to the famous Little Mermaid statue! We approached from the canal side while a throng of tourists were taking photos of it on land.

            - On the way back to GoBoat headquarters, we went through a quieter canal, in which Michael and I decided to go for a quick swim. The water was freezing on this overcast day, but we thought it was just too good of an opportunity to pass up – being able to say we’d gone for a dip in a Copenhagen canal!

            - So we did, and I almost drowned because I realised I have no ability to fend for myself in deep water. This is a slight exaggeration, but I was basically hanging onto Michael for most of the time, and ended up having a life jacket thrown to me. But still fun!

            - We went to a restaurant called SimpleRAW for dinner – a restaurant that served only raw vegan food. We’d made a reservation, but apparently “the restaurant got full”, so the four of us were crammed into a small table with another couple. A rather disappointing start to the night, but after repeatedly making excuses, the waitress did eventually apologise to us (and it didn’t hurt that she offered us a free dessert too). The other couple soon finished their meal and departed, so by the time our food came we had the table to ourselves, and it was absolutely delicious.

            - On the final morning of our holiday, Michael and I bid farewell to my parents as they boarded a train to the airport, London-bound. We then hopped on board the first leg of our eleven-hour journey back to Tübingen. We were well-prepared for this, having packed laptops, Kindles, and sketchbooks with which to pass the time.

            - "At around lunchtime, an announcement came over the train’s PA system: “We are experiencing a short delay as the ferry is running late”. Ferry?!"
            - It turns out that rather than taking the rather long route across many bridges through Denmark’s islands to get to Germany, our train was to take a shortcut – a ferry from Rødbyhavn to Puttgarden.
            - After the aforementioned short delay, our train slowly moved forward onto the train tracks inside the ferry. Once it had come to a stop, we were asked to disembark (though we could leave our luggage in the train).

            - The delayed ferry did however set us back a bit. We missed our connection in Hamburg, and hence also missed our next connections in Frankfurt and Stuttgart. The Deutsche Bahn people sorted us out with tickets for the next trains, but it did make it rather a long trip.
            - We finally arrived in Tübingen at a little after 11pm - thirteen hours after we’d left Copenhagen. We caught a bus up the hill to our apartment and fell asleep, finally reaching the end of our month-and-a-bit long holiday.
