            - We had a lovely night’s sleep aboard the boat, and after a delicious breakfast we arrived in The Netherlands (IJmuiden, to be specific). From here we spent a few minutes going through immigration (it was a fairly speedy process) and boarded one of the ferry’s buses to take us into Amsterdam itself.

            - We arrived in Amsterdam at the tail end of the annual GayPride celebrations, so the city was full of tourists, revellers, and rainbow flags. The city was pretty crowded, with a sort of lively, cheerful atmosphere. We spent some time wandering and looking at the beautiful old houses and the canals. Thankfully, having spent heaps of time in Germany, we were already used to cycle paths and knew to avoid them, so we didn’t get run over by any Dutch locals.

            - Another interesting (but not unexpected) thing about Amsterdam was the abundance of ‘coffee shops’ i.e. places selling the local delicacy, i.e. marijuana. Weed is not actually legal in the Netherlands, but if I remember correctly, the consumption of it is decriminalised and the police turn a blind eye to establishments that sell it, so long as they don’t cause any trouble. Growing marijuana, on the other hand, is not so tolerated. Anyway, this means that walking through Amsterdam invariably leads to catching whiffs of it from establishments and passing strangers.
            - For lunch, we found an Australian-themed restaurant called Coco’s Outback. It was actually reasonably authentic, e.g. their Oz burger did indeed include beetroot and pineapple. The menu also included bush tucker (grubs of some sort, I think, and other stuff I can’t remember). Michael got a burger and I ordered beef ribs which turned out to be on a rack the length of my forearm, which I did actually end up finishing. It was good.

            - We lazily wandered down to Amsterdam’s national monument to join yet another walking tour (that’s three in four days, if you’re keeping score). We grabbed a healthy breakfast of Dutch pancakes and churros, and began the tour. Our guide explained that Dutch people are rather uninventive when naming landmarks, and that the national monument where the tour had begun was called the National Monument.
            - He informed us one of our first stops would be a place he affectionately referred to as “Mount Amsterdam” – the highest point in the whole city. We climbed about eight stairs, and he announced we had arrived! He explained that this 1.3m above sea level land was not naturally occurring – it had been built in order to prevent the famously low-lying city from becoming flooded. The street that ran along it was hence called Zeedijk, or Sea Dyke.
            - We then saw the thinnest house in Amsterdam - the little red one in the middle of the photo below.

        text: Our guide also showed us the Jewish district, an area that didn’t have the same old style houses as many other parts of the city. Sadly, of course, this was due to the area being bombed by the Germans during the Second World War, and also due to the later-empty houses that remained being looted by desperate Amsterdam inhabitants during a hellishly cold wartime winter. Since then, the area had been rebuilt, with some of the buildings based on the works of architecture students.

            - We travelled to a park in the south side of the city called Vondelpark, where we spent about an hour relaxing and eating some hot dogs from a local vendor. The stand offered a selection of toppings which you could add yourself, including some salted baked potato pieces, much like teeny tiny chips – they gave our hot dogs a very pleasant crunch.

        text: We then took a canal tour on a small open boat with about ten other people. Our boat driver took us through the canals and out onto the River Amstel proper (‘Amsterdam’ deriving from the name of a dam on the Amstel River). It was a lovely day and a nice way to take a look at the city.

            - The first thing we did was drop our clothes off at a laundromat. Here, like everywhere else, the people spoke English; I’m convinced that in Amsterdam you could get around fine without having to speak a word of Dutch, due to its nature as a tourist hub (and also due to globalisation). We then got some breakfast at a delicious pancake restaurant.

            - The rest of the day was basically spent doing some more walking around the city, buying some souvenirs for friends, and resting at the hotel.
            - That evening we did another Sandeman’s walking tour, this time of the historic Red Light District. Our guide was an Australian who had been living in the Netherlands for six years, and he was quite friendly and had a lot of interesting stuff to tell us. We were informed of the history of the area, how it has evolved to become what it is today, and about some of the city’s plans to redevelop it.

            - After checking out of the NH Carlton hotel that morning, we headed to Amsterdam Centraal station. Michael had a plan for that day, which I presumed meant accommodation at another locale, but had deliberately told me nothing about it. We hung out at the station for a while, enjoying some Starbucks delicacies, before heading to the ferry terminal and boarding a vessel that, half an hour later, deposited us at the dockyards.

            - This dockyards area of Amsterdam used to be an industrial place where ships were built/repaired/etc., but nowadays it’s used as a popular venue for music festivals and the like. When we arrived, there were people packing up the temporary infrastructure from the last event. We spent about fifteen(?) minutes wandering around while Michael looked for something. I still, at this point, didn’t know where we were staying. I had spotted a crane, however, and Michael and I had made several stupid jokes about cranes for a while now, but for some reason I’m not sure if it ever occurred to me that…
            - We would be staying in a crane!

            - We took the tiny industrial lift up to the room, whose doors opened onto a very plush apartment. Our room was lovely, very well-decorated and quite spacious, especially considering it was a box inside a crane. Everything looked vaguely quirky, expensive, and excellent. There was a staircase upstairs, which contained a bed and a gigantic bath tub. We also had a balcony, which was tiny but also very... open to the air.

        text:
            - There was also a hot tub at the top of the crane, on the level above our room. It was shared by the guests of the hotel (though there were only three rooms, so that wasn’t really a problem). On the elevator there was a little panel where you could indicate whether the jacuzzi was free or occupied. And so we took the lift up and spent some time soaking in the tub – which, by the way, was just placed on the floor of that level, not inside a room or anything but open to the air – and admiring the views of Amsterdam from above.

            - Nearby the crane was a large warehouse. It had been used as part of the dry-dock's daily operations, but since they went bust in the 1980s it had been converted into an art space. We had a short wander through it before dinner.
            - We dined at a nearby restaurant called Bistro Noord – a lovely place just about a hundred meters away from the base of the crane.
            - After dinner we caught the lift up to the top level of the crane and walked past the jacuzzi out on to the crane’s arm. There was very little by way of safety – a small step to the left or right of the platform could’ve resulted in an awful fall. We made it to the very end and admired the view of the sun setting, before hurriedly walking back to the relative safety of the crane’s tower.

It was two giant hampers of food, including: an English breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.), a continental breakfast (bread rolls, croissants, cold cuts, cheeses), as well as yoghurt, a couple of cans of Red Bull, and two bottles of prosecco. Everything was in huge portions and we barely finished half of it, unfortunately. But yeah, it was amazing.'

            - In Bottrop sits a rather unique “hotel” – a former sewage treatment plant which has since been converted into a beautiful park and restaurant. The management had also purchased five wide sewage pipes (unused), placed them around the park and installed beds in them.

        text:
            - To call them cramped would be an understatement – the bed takes up about ¾ of the pipe, and there’s a small bench for your possessions running alongside it. The floor space is perhaps about 50cm long – just enough to don one’s shoes before leaving the park. But it was nonetheless charming – the view out the front door was spectacular, and we were looking forward to spending two nights simply relaxing.

            - We had dinner at the restaurant at BernePark. The food was good but the dinner as a whole was peppered with minor inconveniences. Michael accidentally ordered a non-alcoholic beer for himself, which turned out to be malt-flavoured and unpleasantly saccharine. I received the wrong order, it got sent back, and when the meal I had ordered turned up, I discovered that it was rather meagre and not at all what I expected (which wasn’t their fault, but still). We were also plagued by a small horde of things that looked like wasps, but which we decided couldn’t be wasps because wasps are meant to be formidable and scary, whereas these things were, quite simply, idiots. That is, we swatted them (with cutlery, menus, our bare hands), and actually hit them, and they neither stung us nor moved away from our dinner.
            - Later, Michael found some discussion on the Internet that indicated that they were probably real wasps. In which case, they luckily didn’t sting us.

        text: Our second day at BernePark was a full day of relaxing, in which we didn’t even leave the park at all. We hung out in our pipe, napping, reading, drawing, and watching TV on Michael’s laptop. It was kind of a hot day, but relatively pleasant inside our pipe.

            - That morning, I accidentally twisted my ankle while walking. It was rather painful, but I could still walk, though with a slight limp. We took a taxi to the train station, as it was raining and we were laden with heavy bags, and boarded our train to Bielefeld.

            - We had decided to visit Bielefeld because it is the subject of a German Internet meme that purports that it does not exist, and is a conspiracy of the government and/or aliens. As far as I remember, there wasn’t anything hugely special about the town other than this joke, but it was rather pleasing to stay a night there nonetheless.

        text:
            - My bag had been slowly ripping through the trip and my shoes’ soles had worn down to the point where I had been slipping rather regularly, so we decided this would be a good chance to upgrade. There was a large department store just five minutes away, so Sunny and I walked there – a decision we would soon regret. Sunny’s ankle started becoming more and more painful as we shopped, so I found Sunny a seat in the shoe section where she patiently waited for me to find the right pair of shoes, while providing helpful guidance about what looked good on me.
            - After a successful shopping trip Sunny half limped, half leaned-on-me back to the hotel where she lay on our big comfortable bed with a freshly purchased ice pack on her foot. I dashed out to pick us up some take-away dinner which I brought back to the room for her.

        text: We spent our first couple of hours in Hannover wandering around a large pedestrian mall, which was very nice. It was inhabited by some buskers, one group of them being a trio of young violinists. They were pretty talented, and Michael and I spent some time hypothesising about how we could make them popular if we were managers.

        text: After more than three weeks of holidaying, we finally started writing this blog (well, the UK part of it) in the hotel, then ambled out to buy dinner at an all-you-can-eat place in the pedestrian mall. It was rather cheap, but drinks were quite expensive – they need to get their money back somehow – but it was lovely. On our way back to the hotel we stopped off at Mövenpick and bought some ice creams.

            - We walked back through the pedestrian mall to the station, where we boarded a train to the rather unique city of Halberstadt. This was the city where the first organ with a modern keyboard (like a piano keyboard) was invented, way back in 1461. We arrived to what looked like a ghost town – plenty of apartments and offices, but almost nobody walking the streets. A fairly typical Sunday in Germany, but a rather creepy introduction to a town.
            - After being informed that no taxis were available because so few were running, we waited 20 minutes for a tram, then walked another ten minutes and finally checked in to our hotel – a beautiful (and incredibly spacious) semi-wooded building in a picturesque part of town.

            - We left the hotel to head towards a formerly abandoned cathedral. This cathedral was, in fact, the entire reason we were in Halberstadt – to witness a small part of the longest musical performance in human history.
            - The piece in question is <i>As Slow As Possible</i> by John Cage, a composer famous for <i>4′33″</i>, a piece of music consisting entirely of rests. <i>As Slow As Possible</i> is played on the organ, and its only instruction to the performer is to play it “as slow as possible”. Most performances last between 20 and 60 minutes, but this one is rather unique – it began in 2001 and will last 639 years.

            - We found the cathedral and were let in by its guardian. The building still shows many signs of disrepair, and is constantly filled by the haunting sound of the chord currently being played. This chord began in 2013 and will have a note added to it in 2020. Each note change is of course accompanied by a ceremony, and the pipes are actually added and removed to/from the organ as required.

The food we ordered was tasty and was served in predictably huge portions.

We made it into the hotel where we discovered the room had no air conditioning. So we opened the windows wide, and enjoyed the beautiful sound of a busy intersection, complete with traffic, trams, and strikingly regular emergency vehicles. We eventually decided that our desire to rest was overcome by our desire to be cold and quiet, and found a nearby café in which we ate dinner.

            - Our full day in Berlin was spent hanging out with various people. I’d arranged for us to meet up with John, a Berlin-dwelling boyfriend of one of my friends. We’d chatted to him a bit online but hadn’t met him yet, of course.
            - We met up with John at the Weltzeituhr (a fancy world clock) at Alexanderplatz, and spent the day wandering around and visiting various establishments. Our first stop was a nice café in the inner courtyard area of some fancy apartments, where we bought drinks and chatted for a while.

In addition to the regular fruits, other items provided to dip in the fondue included cookies, brownies, Belgian waffles, and even small scoops of ice cream. We tried our hardest, but couldn’t finish it.

        text: John then took us to Boesner, an art store which had many locations in Germany and was packed with supplies. After much browsing, I bought two small sketchbooks and a set of artist pens. John (also into art) spent about four times what I did, buying some very expensive hand-made paper and some brushes and inks. Michael did not buy things, but spent a while perusing a book of interestingly-designed bookshelves.

            - Our final stop with John was a bar called Klunker Kranich. We’d been told that it sat atop a shopping mall, but the three of us were utterly unable to find it. After much travelling up and down the lifts, we ended up wandering through their carpark staring at the ceiling with no idea how to get there.
            - We eventually discovered the entrance – it was simply the ramp in the carpark. The entire top level had been closed off to cars and converted to a beautiful bar with views overlooking the city. There were still parking spots painted on the ground, and all the previous infrastructure (street lamps and such) remained. And best of all, there was a sprinkler in which to cool down.

        text: We said goodbye to John and headed off into the other side of Berlin, where we had arranged to have dinner with Holly (a girl from my UTS German class) and her boyfriend Wade, who were living in Berlin during Holly’s exchange year. We met at a Tamil restaurant which was very busy, so the food took an hour or so to arrive, but that was fine because we all got along pretty well and the food turned out to be delicious. We also ended up chatting a bit to the two men who were sharing our dinner table (this started because I accidentally mistook one of them for a waiter) – one was a German expat who lived in Romania, and the other (not a waiter) was Romanian. We talked about travel a fair bit, and it was a lovely evening overall.

        text: Our hotel’s breakfast buffet was small, but fantastic. The food was delicious, but most impressive was the décor – both the indoor and outdoor dining sections were exquisitely designed. After a relaxing meal, we made our way to the train station.

            - A forty-five minute train later, we arrived at Brand station and were taken by shuttle bus to Tropical Islands – a very fascinating theme park/resort which Michael had organised as a surprise and only told me about the day before we arrived.
            - Basically, a couple of decades ago, a group of people in Germany had tried to get the airship business going again. They built a giant hangar, which became the largest enclosed open space in the world (no pillars, walls, etc.), but their backers pulled out before they could get ’round to building any airships. The space ended up being sold for a third of the price at which it was built, and now it has been transformed into a tropical-themed park filled with pools, water slides, a sauna and spa village, a small theatre, and many different types of accommodation (e.g. tents, stylised huts, beach houses, etc.). The park is also fully climate controlled.

            - Michael had booked us in for two nights, in an absolutely amazing room. It was one of the Designer Lodges at the interior edge of the dome, so we had windows looking both into the park and out of it. The room was very spacious, with high ceilings, and very well-decorated with elegant neutral tones in the room. The bathroom was very modern, with a rain shower and striking crimson walls. There were also some excellent decorations inside, such as a gnarled length of tree a bit shorter than my height, which had had veins of clear plastic and silvery metal incorporated into the bark.

            - After depositing our belongings, our first stop was the waterslide tower – in fact, it was the tallest in Germany. There were three slides attached at different heights coloured red, yellow, and blue. The red slide required one to be carrying a tube on which to slide, so we walked past it. The yellow one had a pretty long queue, so we passed it too.

            - So there we were, atop the tallest waterslide tower in the country. I waited for the little light to turn green, then climbed in and went for it.
            - This waterslide is much like being in a washing machine, only a washing machine that has been thrown out of an aeroplane. It begins with a steep drop, down which people apparently travel up to 70 km/h, continues with a little more steep dropping, and eventually rather aggressively throws you into a rather shallow pool of water which you must promptly exit so the person behind you can become as battered as you are.
            - It was brilliant.

        text: When not on waterslides, we spent a lot of time relaxing in the pools. They were heated, and relatively shallow (deepest was about shoulder/neck height for me), and quite large. There were also features such as fountains and smaller slides. The water was very nice, and didn’t leave you stinking of chlorine after you left. Most of the first day was spent either on waterslides or splashing about in the pools.

            - Our second day at Tropical Islands was largely spent exploring the spa and sauna village. I had never been to saunas or steam rooms before, so it was rather interesting for me. We decided to visit a sauna first. After some short cold showers, we entered the sauna room.
            - It was incredibly hot. I had been expecting this, but still. Funnily enough, the intense heat wasn’t quite as unpleasant as I imagined. It was rather relaxing, but after a bit it got too much, at which point we had our second round of cold showers, which were now invigorating rather than simply icy.
            - We also visited some steam rooms, which were not quite as hot as the saunas, unless you were walking through the steam – if you were just sitting or lying still, it was less hot. These were also very relaxing.
            - After that we visited a second sauna, which was quite fragrantly perfumed. However, I couldn’t help eyeing the pile of hot coals in the centre of the room and thinking about how easy it’d be for someone to push me into them. So that distracted me a bit from the relaxing.
            - Finally, we found some jacuzzis, in which the water was a relatively cool temperature, but where the bubbles ranged from light and pleasant to incredibly intense. I think Michael enjoyed them all, but I found the bubbles in the strongest pool a little too much like being lightly punched. Nonetheless, it was a very pleasant day spent at the village.
            - 'For dinner we visited a restaurant in the dome, which served some delicious and very well-presented food. We both ordered steaks for our mains, but in my opinion the real highlight was the starter that we shared: a grilled Portobello mushroom served with halloumi, basil pesto, cherry tomato, rocket, and shaved parmesan.'

        text: While Sunny slept in, I went for a morning walk around the inside of the dome. I then wandered out the front and took my drone up to once again take photos and videos of the spectacular structure in which we were staying.

        text: Our final morning at Tropical Islands was mostly spent enjoying the waterslides one last time. We spent the most time on the red waterslide, which wasn’t terrifyingly fast (unlike the blue one), but had a fair amount of twists and turns. Visitors had to sit on inflated donut-shaped rings while going down. It was usually one person to a ring, but we’d seen children share rings, and the promotional video that Tropical Islands had playing in their shuttle bus had sown two adults sharing one. So Michael and I did that, which was pretty fun. I then went for a second time on the red slide, but I accidentally managed to push my ring down the slide before I’d gotten onto it… so I made my descent ring-less, which I had seen two boys doing before me, so I figured it couldn’t have been too bad. And it was kind of fun, actually, but also mildly embarrassing that I’d lost the ring, so I went a final time, properly.

            - We then checked out of the hotel, and began the seven hour journey to Frankfurt, during which we wrote this blog post. We will be staying one night in a hotel near Frankfurt Airport, then meeting Sunny’s parents when their flight lands at 6:40am tomorrow morning.
            - And, without sounding too much like an advertisement, you’ll be able to read all about our trip with them right here on this very same blog.
